            Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for Intel x86–based personal computers,
            but has since been ported to more computer hardware platforms than any other operating system. It is
            the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and supercomputers,
            but is used on only around 1.5% of desktop computers.
        
            Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose
            operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system; this includes
            mobile phones, tablet computers, network routers, facility automation controls, televisions and video game consoles.
            Android, the most widely used operating system for tablets and smartphones, is built on top of the Linux kernel.

        
            The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration.
            The underlying source code may be used, modified, and distributed—commercially or non-commercially—by anyone under
            licenses such as the GNU General Public License. Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution,
            for both desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint,
            Fedora, openSUSE, Arch Linux, and the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
            Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting utilities and libraries and usually a large amount of
            application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use.
